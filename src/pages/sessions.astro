        In a MindLooker session, we create a completely non-judgmental space. We'll start with what's important to you, and through a series of precise, non-leading questions, we will explore the material of your mind. There are no exercises, no advice, and no "homework." Just you, and a clear, unobstructed view of your own inner landscape.

        It's a different approach to examining your own material in a neutral space.
