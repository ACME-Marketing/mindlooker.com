      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        So many practitioners feel stuck offering temporary solutions to deep-rooted problems. The MindLooker 1-on-1 Session provides a framework to help clients access their own wisdom and resolve issues at the source. It's not about managing symptoms; it's about facilitating genuine transformation.
