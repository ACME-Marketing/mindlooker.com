          Our Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Traditional therapy often puts the practitioner in the expert seat, creating an unintentional hierarchy. MindLooker was founded on a simple, powerful idea: what if we removed that hierarchy completely?
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          We don't give advice, offer diagnoses, or tell you what to work on. We provide a proven, non-directive process that allows you to look at what's truly there, without judgment or external interpretation. This is a space for your truth.
